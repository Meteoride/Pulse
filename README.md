# Pulse
There has been a pervasive issue meandering into Western Culture: the miracle of mobile connectivity in the advent of the technological age. In the wake of the harmful, isolating effects of social media and mobile addiction, Pulse is a social tool in which users can meet like-minded and like-lifestyled individuals in a community, event-based environment. 
Statistics show that social media is harming the overall happiness and mental well-being of today's youth and young adults. Pulse aims to utilize simple, easy to use technology that will eliminate the barriers that social media tends to produce.
