    <p>Let's be real: our connected devices are pulling us farther apart. Friends or family with whom you once shared real genuine moments, are trapped behind a 3x5 inch display. That's not cool, so we decided to use technology against itself. Pulse aims to repurpose the nature of social networking, communal connectivity, and the internet as a whole, to form and deepen human relationships.</p>
